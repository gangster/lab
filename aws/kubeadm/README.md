Terraform Kubernetes Cluster Deployment
=======================================

Overview
--------

This project automates the creation of a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using Terraform. It's designed to set up a VPC, various security groups, and multiple EC2 instances to form a Kubernetes cluster including control plane and worker nodes.

### Features

*   **Automated VPC Creation**: Configures a VPC with both public and private subnets to host the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Security Groups**: Implements security groups for secure SSH access and for Kubernetes networking.
*   **EC2 Instances for Kubernetes**: Provisions EC2 instances for the Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes.
*   **IAM Role Configuration**: Establishes IAM roles for EC2 instances, ensuring they have appropriate permissions.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
*   Terraform (v1.7 or later) installed on your local machine.
*   AWS CLI installed and configured with your credentials.

Project Structure
-----------------

*   `main.tf`: Central configuration file that ties together various Terraform modules and resources.
*   `outputs.tf`: Specifies output variables that provide useful information about the resources.
*   `variables.tf`: Defines input variables required for the configuration.
*   `modules/`
    *   `ec2_instance/`: Terraform module to create and manage EC2 instances.
    *   `security_group/`: Terraform module to create and manage AWS security groups.
*   `terraform.tfvars`: (Optional) File for setting variable values.

Getting Started
---------------

### 1. Initialization

Initialize the Terraform workspace, which will download the necessary providers and modules:

csharpCopy code

`terraform init`

### 2. Configuration

Set up your `terraform.tfvars` with the necessary values:

### 3. Planning

Review the actions Terraform will perform before any changes are made to your AWS resources:

`terraform plan`

### 4. Apply

Execute the plan to create the infrastructure:

`terraform apply`

### 5. Access and Management

*   The output of `terraform apply` will include public IPs and instance IDs.
*   Use these details to access and manage your Kubernetes cluster.

### 6. Clean Up

When you no longer need the resources, remove them with:
`terraform destroy`

Customization and Scaling
-------------------------

*   You can modify the `instance_type` in `terraform.tfvars` to scale the resources according to your needs.
*   Security rules can be adjusted in the `security_group` module as per your security requirements.

Best Practices
--------------

*   **Security**: Handle sensitive data like AWS credentials and SSH keys securely.
*   **State Management**: Use remote state storage like S3 for team environments.
*   **Versioning**: Pin module and provider versions for consistent deployments.
